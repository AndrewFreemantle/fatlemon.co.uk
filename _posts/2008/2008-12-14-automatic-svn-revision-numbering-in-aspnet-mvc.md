While working on an internal <a title="ASP.Net MVC Homepage" href="http://www.asp.net/mvc" target="_self">ASP.Net MVC</a> project at work, I wondered if it was possible to get the SubVersion (SVN) repository number to be automatically updated on the webpages I was creating every time I did a build or check-in.

The footer at the bottom of the [StackOverflow.com](http://www.stackoverflow.com "StackOverflow") site is what we're trying to do here (though I suspect after listening to [their podcasts](https://stackoverflow.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W24212 "StackOverflow Podcast 17") that they've got theirs updated using custom build tasks in [Cruise Control.Net](http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET "CruiseControl.Net")..

After a couple of hours of investigation, trial and error, here's one way to do it.

Before we begin, we'll need [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ "Tortoise SVN Client") installed, and a local working copy of your ASP.Net MVC project checked out.

There are essentially 3 steps..

### 1. Create a <a title="Html Helpers 'How Do I' video - ASP.Net MVC Website" href="http://www.asp.net/learn/mvc-videos/video-402.aspx" target="_self">Html Helper</a>

This greatly simplifies the return of the SVN number as a string which is then trivial to place in our View Page or footer.

Create the following file: `HtmlHelpers.vb`..   
{% highlight vbnet %}
Imports System.Runtime.CompilerServices

Public Module HtmlHelpers

	<extension()> _  
	Public Function SVNRevision(ByVal helper As HtmlHelper) As String  
	  Dim svnFile As IO.StreamReader  
	  Dim svnRev As String = String.Empty  
	  Try  
	    svnFile = New IO.StreamReader("svn_rev.txt")  
	    svnRev = svnFile.ReadLine()  
	    svnRev = svnRev.Replace("""", "")  
	    svnFile.Close()  
	  Catch FnFex As IO.FileNotFoundException  
	    'swallow, but write out the file and location we tried to read..  
	    Trace.WriteLine("HtmlHelper.SVNRevision: Ex: [" & FnFex.Message & "]")  
	  Finally  
	    If svnRev.Length = 0 Then svnRev = "-"  
	  End Try

	  Return svnRev  
	End Function  

End Module  
{% endhighlight %}

### 2. Create a Batch File and add it as a custom build task to the project

Next we create a Batch File (.bat) in the root of our project, which will call the TortoiseSVN command to retrieve the SVN revision number from our working copy.  
We'll call it `CreateSvnRevFile.bat`. Here's the contents:
 
{% highlight batch %}   
@echo off  
rem # CreateSvnRevFile.bat  
rem # Check the Working Copy folder is passed in..  
if /I [%1%]==[] goto usage else goto start  
:start  
rem # (Re)Create the base file so SubWCRev has something to replace  
echo "$WCREV$" > svn_rev.txt  
rem # Ask SubWCRev to replace with the latest revision  
rem # from the current (working copy) directory  
C:\Progra~1\TortoiseSVN\bin\SubWCRev.exe %1 svn\_rev.txt svn\_rev.txt  
rem # Copy the file for local hosting and testing purposes..  
copy svn_rev.txt "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE" /Y  
del svn_rev.txt /Q  
goto end

:usage  
echo Usage: %0 SvnWorkingCopyDir

:end  
rem exit 0  
{% endhighlight %}

Then we need to add a custom Build Event action to call the Batch File. (The Build Events dialog is in "My Project > Compile > Build Events")

![My Project - Compile - Build Events]({{ site.imageurl }}2008/SVN-BuildEvents.png "Visual Studio - Build Events dialogue box")

As shown above, we need to add the following line to the "Post-build event command line:" box..  
 
{% highlight batch %}
call "$(ProjectDir)CreateSvnRevFile.bat" "$(SolutionDir)\"  
{% endhighlight %}

### 3. Add the SVN revision number to our Page

With all of that background plumbing in place, all we need to do now is add a couple of lines of code in the appropriate `.aspx` file wherever we want our SVN revision number to appear:  

{% highlight aspx-cs %}  
...
<%@ import Namespace="MyMvcProject" %>  
...
<%= Html.SVNRevision() %>  
... 
{% endhighlight %}

The first line imports our Project Namespace (which will obviously depend on your project - you may need to rebuild at this point before the `<%= Html.` autocomplete picks up the `.SVNRevision()` HtmlHelper).

And we're done:

![]({{ site.imageurl }}2008/SVN-OPSWeb.png)

   
#### So, how does it work?

The Post-build task `CreateSvnRevFile.bat` does most of the work by creating a temporary text file called `svn_rev.txt` containing the string "$WCREV$", and then calls the TortoiseSVN command SubWCRev.exe on the text file to replace the string with the working copy revision number.Â  It's worth noting that the revision number is held in the working copy .svn folder so this method doesn't require a call to your SVN server to work.

The Html Helper code then simply tries to read the updated text file and returns the contents as a string, or it returns a dash ("-") if there was a problem.

Obviously, if we're using this on a high-traffic website or frequently referenced page then we'd want to cache the string rather than reading it from the file every time. We could do this by modifying the Html Helper to read the file once into a variable, which we could do by wrapping the actual file reading up in a singleton object, for example.
