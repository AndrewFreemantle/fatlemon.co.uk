![My Toblerone Cheesecake]({{ site.imageurl }}2008/TobleroneCheesecake.jpg)

I don't have a [sweet tooth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_tooth "Sweet Tooth - Wikipedia") as such, but I have discovered a talent for making desserts - that or my family and friends are very complimentary ðŸ˜‰

I think I'd heard of [The Cheesecake Factory](http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/ "The Cheesecake Factory") before my first trip to the United States of America, so when our hotel taxi took us past [the one on Camelback Road in Phoenix](http://www.yelp.com/biz/cheesecake-factory-phoenix "The Cheesecake Factory, Phoenix, AZ - Yelp.com reviews") we had to double back after checking in. I can testify to the first comment that the "Portions are ginormous"!

A couple of months later, I decided to make a cheesecake to take into work for my Birthday, and although The Cheesecake Factory had pretty much every flavour, they didn't have a Toblerone one, so, inspired by their "Chocolate Chip Cookie-Dough Cheesecake" - I'd not seen floating pieces of yumminess in the cheesecake bit before - I found a basic cheesecake recipe and experimented.

This is the latest version that was a huge success at my most recent Birthday celebrations. Those mathematically minded of you will note the recipe uses only &frac23; of the Toblerone..

#### For the Base
- 1 Packet of [Hob Nobs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hob_Nobs "Hob Nobs - Wikipedia") or Digestives (500g)
- 1 Small Packet of [Oreos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreo "Oreos - Wikipedia") (optional)
- 1/3 Block of Butter (about 90g)

#### For the Cheesecake
- 400g Bar of [Toblerone][5]
- 450g of Cream Cheese (Philadelphia)
- 250g Caster Sugar
- 250g CrÃ¨me FraÃ®che
- 475ml Double Cream

#### For the Topping
- 200ml of Double Cream

#### Serves: 8-10 people

### Method
#### Create the base first
  1. Break-up the Hobs Nobs or Digestives and optional Oreos into crumbs, I do this by emptying them all into a [Sandwich Bag (or Ziploc)][6], and hitting them repeatedly with a large Branston Pickle jar which I can also employ as a makeshift rolling pin.
  2. Make sure there aren't any large crumbs left, then melt the butter in a medium sized pan over a low heat and stir all of the mashed-up biscuit crumbs into the butter. The crumbs will easily soak up the butter, become a little darker in colour and just start to stick together. Save the sandwich bag..
  3. Take a 23cm (8") [springform tin][7], and cut a piece of grease-proof paper for the bottom (I lightly dab the tray with butter in a couple of places to hold the paper in place)
  4. Turn out the buttery-crumb mixture into the tin, even out, then using something with a flat surface (such as a church candle wrapped in clingfilm) pat the mixture down evenly to compress it
  5. Place in the fridge to set while you continue with the main cheesecake part..

#### Create the cheesecake
  1. Break off about a 3rd of the Toblerone peaks and place them in the same Sandwich bag (give it a good shake out first!), and with the same Branston Pickle jar mash the Toblerone into smallish chunks, roughly 1-1.5cm in size
  2. Place all of the other ingredients into a large bowl, and electric whisk together until smooth
  3. Stir in the battered Toblerone pieces to the mixture, then empty the lot onto the base in your springform tin, pushing the mixture into the edges and getting the top as smooth and level as you can
  4. Put it back in the fridge to set, ideally overnight

#### Create the topping
  1. Break off about a 3rd of the Toblerone, and <a title="How to melt chocolate - Delia Online" href="http://deliaonline.com/cookery-school/how-to/how-to-melt-chocolate,52,AR.html" target="_blank">melt it in a small bowl over a pan of simmering water</a>.
  2. Add the double cream a bit at a time, stirring it all in before adding more, until it's all in there. It will get quite runny but that's fine
  3. Retrieve your cheesecake from the fridge and slowly pour the melted Toblerone topping onto it. Guide the topping so it all gets covered then place it back in the fridge to turn sticky
  4. It should be ready in about an hour or so.

Best served chilled with squirty cream ðŸ˜‹

### Variations
To make the base a bit more interesting you can use broken up bits of [Cinder Toffee][8] instead of Oreos (which you can make, though I bought!). You can also add extra topping layers - I made a Toblerone Cheesecake with a layer of melted marshmallow under the melted Toblerone topping once which worked very well too
