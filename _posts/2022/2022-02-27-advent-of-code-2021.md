> **Advent of Code** is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

I will admit that when I heard about Advent of Code my first thoughts were *"why on earth would I want to do that? There are so many other things I'd rather be doing with my time!"* ... however, after a week or so my curiosity got the better of me and after reading the [the first puzzle introduction](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1 "Day 1: Sonar Sweep") my mind changed to thoughts of *"this seems quite straightforward and shouldn't take too long"* - famous last words, I know...

It also seemed like a good opportunity to play with [the recent release of .NET 6](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6/) which [I'd been](https://dotnetrocks.com/?show=1761) [following with interest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM6OO2lkxA4).

Cue some quick puzzle solution wins as the early tasks did prove straighforward (phew!) and Advent of Code quickly found a home in my early morning routine alongside my first cuppa.

Without giving too much away about the puzzles themselves, each day a new two-stage puzzle is made available with the second stage typically a continuation or extension, say, with a larger input dataset. It was particularly satisfying when the initial approach I'd come up with needed little or no adaptation <i class="fa fa-smile-o text-warning"></i>

Although I only did about half of the advent, I have to say I heartily enjoyed it - it was challenging and fun to have to re-think simple approaches to handle exponential data sets, or [researching shortest path algorithms on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem)

Thanks to the creator, [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) - see you again in December!
